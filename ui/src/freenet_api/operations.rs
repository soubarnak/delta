// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// freenet-migrate decision driver
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Delta's initial-capture sweep is adopted onto freenet-migrate's sans-IO
// `ProbeDriver` (the same decision machinery River and riverctl ship). The
// binding below is deliberately thin: every state decision delegates to the
// incident-hardened `reconcile_into` (delta#33/#34), so the driver's fold IS
// Delta's tombstone-aware, commutative merge — there is no second merge
// implementation that could silently drift from the one the existing tests
// pin.
//
// Policy is `FoldAll`: Delta already folds *every* legacy generation into
// local state (its concurrent sweep is a FoldAll realized concurrently). The
// `policy_check` property tests mechanically confirm the merge is commutative,
// idempotent, and fold-order-invariant over the tombstone-era generations, and
// the `FoldAllAck` is the loud acknowledgement of the preconditions. Two honest
// bounds on that soundness — BOTH pre-existing, shared identically by today's
// concurrent per-response sweep, so adopting the driver introduces neither:
//
//   * The tombstone precondition holds only for the TOMBSTONE-ERA lineage. The
//     oldest registry generation (C1, "Pre-tombstone WASM") predates tombstones,
//     so a page deleted before tombstones existed can resurrect through the fold
//     from C1. This is the pre-existing accepted residual from the delta#34-era
//     analysis (the fix that added tombstones); floor-vs-no-floor is tracked in
//     delta#38.
//   * The merge is order-INDEPENDENT only where writes do not conflict at an
//     equal (page `updated_at` / config `version`), and where a page is not
//     deleted twice at different `deleted_at`. Same-timestamp conflicting writes
//     (e.g. concurrent tabs) resolve keep-accumulator, and conflicting tombstones
//     (`SiteState::merge`'s `deleted_pages` or_insert) likewise keep the
//     accumulator's deletion — both order-dependent. Harmless: for the tombstone
//     conflict the page stays deleted either way, only the recorded deletion
//     timestamp differs; and the PUT payload is the canonical concurrently-merged
//     SITES value, so the fold matches production arrival-order behavior exactly.

// Per-prefix migration sweep: batched single forward PUT
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Honest framing: `reconcile_into` still owns the production data decisions —
// every legacy / stale-key / self-heal candidate GET is fired concurrently (the
// concurrent fan-out is Delta's strength, unchanged) and each response is STILL
// reconciled into SITES + backed up to the delegate immediately (per-response
// visibility preserved). The freenet-migrate driver's role here is to VALIDATE
// and PIN the fold (via `DeltaProbeOps` + the property tests, which prove the
// merge is a sound `FoldAll`) and to BOUND the sweep into ONE decision, not to
// re-implement the merge.
//
// What changes vs the pre-driver code: the forward PUT. It used to re-PUT the
// reconciled state to the current contract key on EVERY legacy response that
// changed local state; now the fired candidates' responses are accumulated and,
// once every candidate has resolved (a GET response, a NotFound, or a
// per-candidate timeout), a single forward PUT of the reconciled state fires —
// gated on a legacy generation having actually changed SITES, so a dominated
// sweep never write-amplifies. This is the "one-final-PUT" adoption
// (freenet-migrate#6). The state PUT is the canonical reconciled SITES value
// (`forward_put_current_site`), which the per-response merges (the same
// `reconcile_into`) already produced — never the driver's `Outcome::merged`.
//
// Divergences vs the pre-driver per-response PUT (both bounded):
//   1. Benign: with no lost candidate, the same reconciled state is PUT once at
//      completion instead of once per changing generation. End state identical.
//   2. Real, and specifically handled: a candidate whose GET is slow enough to
//      lose the race to its 30s timeout is first recorded as a miss (possibly
//      COMPLETING and finalizing the sweep); its real response then arrives,
//      reconciles newer data into SITES, and — because the sweep is already
//      gone — would NOT propagate to the current key. That is caught by
//      `plan_late_response_action` -> `LateResponseAction::ForwardPutNow`, a
//      one-off forward PUT for the late change. (If the sweep is still live, the
//      late change instead re-arms the eventual finalize via
//      `MigrationSweep::resolve`'s changed_local OR.)
