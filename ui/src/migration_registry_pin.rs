//! Pins for the build-time legacy-delegate registry.
//!
//! `ui/build.rs` turns `legacy_delegates.toml` into the `LEGACY_DELEGATES`
//! constant that the startup sweep uses to find the delegate holding a
//! returning user's signing keys and site list. If that table ships stale or
//! empty, the sweep asks the wrong delegates (or nobody), and the user gets a
//! permanently empty "Welcome to Delta" screen with no error anywhere — the
//! failure mode behind freenet/delta#52.
//!
//! Two distinct pins live here, and they fail under different conditions:
//!
//! 1. [`the_baked_registry_matches_the_file_on_disk`] is a real consistency
//!    check, not a source pin. It compares the constant Cargo baked in against
//!    the file read via `include_str!`. `include_str!` lands in rustc's
//!    dep-info, so the test's copy is ALWAYS current; the constant is only
//!    current if the build script actually re-ran. That asymmetry is the whole
//!    point — it is what goes red on a stale INCREMENTAL build.
//!
//!    Honest limitation: a cold build (CI, a fresh clone) always runs the build
//!    script, so there this test cannot be stale and cannot fail. Its
//!    discriminating power is on incremental local builds, which is exactly
//!    where the bug bites — a developer edits the registry and runs
//!    `cargo make publish-delta` without a clean rebuild.
//!
//! 2. [`every_toml_the_build_script_reads_is_declared_to_cargo`] covers the
//!    cold-build case. It IS a source pin — it scrapes `ui/build.rs` text — and
//!    is labelled as one rather than dressed up as behaviour. It closes the
//!    class instead of the instance: any future file the build script reads
//!    must also be declared, or this fails.
